Engineer. I have a highly technical profile with the focus on communicating sophisticated ideas to a non-technical audience. I received my PhD in
mathematical predictive modelling in power systems and electrical machines from the Department of Power Systems, University of CentraleSup√©lec, Paris, France.

  <h2>What I Do</h2>
  <p>
    I love programming, I love to help others and I enjoy exploring new
    technologies in general!
  </p>
  <p>
    My goal is to keep on growing as a developer - and if I could help you do
    the same, I'd be very happy!
